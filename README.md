## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://baseball-pitches.com)

This is just a simple PHP website I made for myself to learn a little more about baseball ⚾ Pitching is like 90% of the game, so I figured if I could recognize the pitches as they are being thrown, I could enjoy the games a little more. And it worked! I have grown to really enjoy watching baseball games : )
